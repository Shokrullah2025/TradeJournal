Ensure a consistent theme across all application pages—Dashboard, Trades, Brokers, Analytics, Templates, Settings, Profile, Billing, and Admin Panel—as well as all components within each page. Apply uniform design guidelines for colors, fonts, styles, background colors, button styles, input fields, and typography to establish a cohesive and professional user experience. Prioritize both usability and aesthetics, adhering to best practices in UI/UX design.
