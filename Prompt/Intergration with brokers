**COMPLETED** âœ…

The application now integrates with real and demo trade brokers using OAuth 2.0 authentication to automatically retrieve account data for entry and exit points directly from the broker, eliminating manual uploads.

**Key Features Implemented:**

- OAuth 2.0 secure authentication flow (no manual API key entry)
- Support for multiple brokers: Tradovate, Alpaca, TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, Interactive Brokers, E\*TRADE, and Demo
- One-click broker connection with official broker login pages
- Automatic token management and refresh
- Real-time trade data synchronization
- Broker selection integrated directly on the Trade page
- Account data normalization across different brokers
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

**How it works:**

1. User clicks on their broker (e.g., Tradovate)
2. Redirected to broker's official login page in a popup
3. User enters credentials on broker's secure site
4. Application receives authorization and exchanges for access token
5. Account data and trades are automatically imported
6. Ongoing synchronization keeps data current

**Security:**

- No API keys or credentials stored in the application
- Industry-standard OAuth 2.0 security
- Tokens automatically expire and refresh
- Users can revoke access from their broker dashboard
