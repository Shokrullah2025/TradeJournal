Design and develop a Trade Journal application inspired by TradeZella using React. The app should allow users to log and analyze their trades, track performance metrics, and generate insights to improve trading strategies. Include features such as trade entry forms, performance dashboards, data visualization tools, and export functionality. Ensure the app has a user-friendly interface and supports secure data storage. Refer to TradeZella's functionality for inspiration while avoiding direct replication. And also add Futures risk to reward calculator.
