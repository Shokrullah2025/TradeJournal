## Original Requirements (Now Completed)

~~Adjust the page layout to display content horizontally for better utilization of space. Implement functionality to simplify template creation, ensuring all existing templates are removed. Add a calendar view that shows the total trade of the day, including numerical values. Use light green to indicate a win and light red to indicate a loss.~~
