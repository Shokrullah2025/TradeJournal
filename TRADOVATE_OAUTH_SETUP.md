# Tradovate OAuth Setup Guide

## Understanding Multi-User OAuth Architecture

### **How OAuth Works for Multiple Users**

**Important:** You're absolutely right to ask about multiple users! Here's how OAuth is designed to work:

#### **One Application, Many Users**

- **Your Application**: Gets **ONE** set of OAuth credentials (client_id, client_secret)
- **Each User**: Has their **own** Tradovate account and gets their **own** access token
- **No Credential Sharing**: Users never share OAuth credentials - each gets unique tokens

#### **The Flow:**

1. **You (Developer)**: Register ONE application with Tradovate â†’ Get client_id/client_secret
2. **User A**: Logs into their Tradovate account via OAuth â†’ Gets token_A
3. **User B**: Logs into their Tradovate account via OAuth â†’ Gets token_B
4. **User C**: Logs into their Tradovate account via OAuth â†’ Gets token_C
5. **Your App**: Uses token_A for User A's data, token_B for User B's data, etc.

### **Current Issue & Solution**

#### **The Problem:**

- We're using placeholder client ID `"3239"`
- This isn't registered with Tradovate
- No real users can authenticate

#### **The Solution:**

1. **You register ONE app** with Tradovate
2. **Get YOUR credentials** (client_id, client_secret)
3. **All users** authenticate through YOUR registered app
4. **Each user** gets their own unique access token

## Requirements to Pass OAuth Authentication

### Step 1: Register with Tradovate Developer Portal

1. **Visit**: [https://developer.tradovate.com](https://developer.tradovate.com)
2. **Create Account**: Sign up for a developer account (ONE time, for you as developer)
3. **Create OAuth Application**: Register your Trade Journal Pro app

### Step 2: Application Registration Details

When registering your application, use these exact settings:

#### Application Name

```
Trade Journal Pro
```

#### Redirect URIs (CRITICAL - Must match exactly)

```
http://localhost:5173/auth/callback/tradovate
```

_For production, add your domain:_

```
https://yourdomain.com/auth/callback/tradovate
```

#### Scopes Required

- `read` - Access account and position data
- `trade` - Execute trades (if needed)

### Step 3: Get Your Application Credentials

After approval, Tradovate will provide **ONE SET** of credentials for your app:

- **Demo Client ID** - For demo/test environment
- **Live Client ID** - For live trading environment
- **Client Secret** - For secure token exchange

### Step 4: Update Your Configuration

1. **Create `.env` file** (copy from `.env.example`):

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. **Update with YOUR app credentials**:

```bash
# These are YOUR application's credentials (not individual users)
VITE_TRADOVATE_DEMO_CLIENT_ID=your-actual-demo-client-id
VITE_TRADOVATE_LIVE_CLIENT_ID=your-actual-live-client-id
VITE_TRADOVATE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-actual-client-secret
```

## How Multiple Users Work (Example)

### **Scenario: 3 Users Using Your App**

#### **Your Setup (One Time):**

```bash
# Your .env file - SAME for all users
VITE_TRADOVATE_DEMO_CLIENT_ID=ABC123
VITE_TRADOVATE_LIVE_CLIENT_ID=XYZ789
VITE_TRADOVATE_CLIENT_SECRET=SECRET456
```

#### **User Authentication Flow:**

**User Alice:**

1. Opens your app â†’ Clicks "Connect Tradovate"
2. OAuth redirects to Tradovate â†’ Alice logs in with her credentials
3. Tradovate redirects back â†’ Your app gets Alice's unique token
4. Alice's token stored: `tradovate_demo_token_alice`

**User Bob:**

1. Opens your app â†’ Clicks "Connect Tradovate"
2. OAuth redirects to Tradovate â†’ Bob logs in with his credentials
3. Tradovate redirects back â†’ Your app gets Bob's unique token
4. Bob's token stored: `tradovate_demo_token_bob`

**User Carol:**

1. Opens your app â†’ Clicks "Connect Tradovate"
2. OAuth redirects to Tradovate â†’ Carol logs in with her credentials
3. Tradovate redirects back â†’ Your app gets Carol's unique token
4. Carol's token stored: `tradovate_demo_token_carol`

#### **Result:**

- **Your app**: Uses same client_id for all OAuth requests
- **Alice**: Gets her account data using her unique token
- **Bob**: Gets his account data using his unique token
- **Carol**: Gets her account data using her unique token
- **Security**: No user sees other users' data

---

## Why This is Secure

### **User Isolation:**

- Each user authenticates with **their own** Tradovate credentials
- Each user gets a **unique** access token
- Tokens are **account-specific** - Alice's token only accesses Alice's data
- Your app **never sees** user passwords - only tokens

### **Your Responsibilities:**

1. **Register your app** with Tradovate (one time)
2. **Keep client_secret secure** (never expose in frontend)
3. **Store user tokens securely** (current implementation uses localStorage)
4. **Handle token expiration** (refresh tokens when needed)

### **User Responsibilities:**

1. **Have their own** Tradovate account
2. **Grant permission** for your app to access their account
3. **Keep their own** Tradovate credentials secure

---

## Current Error Explanation

The error you're seeing:

> "client_id and redirect_uri do not match existing setup"

**Means:**

- Client ID `"3239"` is a placeholder, not registered with Tradovate
- Redirect URI doesn't match any registered application
- **This is expected** until you register your real application

---

## Testing Flow

### **Option 1: Get Real Credentials (Recommended)**

1. Complete Tradovate developer registration
2. Update `.env` with real credentials
3. Test with actual OAuth flow
4. **All users** can then authenticate through your registered app

### **Option 2: Use Mock Mode (Immediate Testing)**

1. I can modify the code to use simulation mode
2. This lets you test the UI flow without real broker connection
3. Users see demo data instead of real accounts

### **Option 3: Alternative Broker**

1. Test with a broker that has easier OAuth setup
2. Many brokers have simpler registration processes
3. Alpaca, for example, has straightforward API access

## Next Steps

**For Production Use:**

1. âœ… **Complete Tradovate registration** (get real client_id/client_secret)
2. âœ… **Update environment variables** with your credentials
3. âœ… **Test OAuth flow** with real Tradovate accounts
4. âœ… **Deploy** with your registered redirect URIs

**For Immediate Testing:**

- Would you like me to implement mock/simulation mode so you can test the user interface flow right now?

**Remember:**

- **ONE application registration** serves **ALL users**
- **Each user** gets their **own unique access token**
- **No credential sharing** between users
- **Secure by design** - users only see their own data

This is exactly how professional trading platforms like Robinhood, E\*TRADE, etc. work - one app, many users, individual tokens! ðŸš€
